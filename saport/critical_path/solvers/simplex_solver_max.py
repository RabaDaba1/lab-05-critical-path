class Solver:
    '''
    Simplex based solver looking for the critical path in the project.
    Uses linear model maximizing length of the path in the project network. 

    Attributes:
    ----------
    project_network: ProjectNetwork
        a project network related to the given project
    model: simplex.model.Model
        a linear model looking for the maximal path in the project network
    Methods:
    --------
    __init__(problem: Project)
        create a solver for the given project
    create_model() -> simplex.model.Model
        builds a linear model of the problem
    solve() -> BasicSolution
        finds the duration of the critical (longest) path in the project network

        # 0) we need as many variables as there are edges in the project network
        # 1) every variable has to be <= 1
        # 2) sum of the variables starting at the initial state has to be equal 1
        # 3) sum of the variables ending at the goal state has to be equal 1
        # 4) for every other node, total flow going trough it has to be equal 0
        #    i.e. sum of incoming arcs minus sum of the outgoing arcs = 0
        # 5) we have to maximize length of the path

        # tip 1. `self.project_network` is the project network you should use
